Readme

This is the complete, professional-grade Dynamic Spawn Engine (DSE). It is designed specifically for a 
Persistent World (PW) environment—balancing ultra-low CPU usage with "Self-Healing" stability.


📜 The "DSE" Encounter System (v1.0)

Dynamic Spawn Engine for NWN:EE

📝 Overview

This system is a low-impact, high-reliability monster spawning engine. It is designed to handle multiple players (like "Bob" and "Bill") in the same room without lagging the server or breaking if a monster gets stuck.

Instead of monsters "reporting" their deaths, a single Brain Script (The Manager) scans the area every 2 minutes to decide what needs to happen.
🛠️ How it Works (The 4 Phases)
1. The Janitor (Cleanup)

Every time the script runs, it looks for dead bodies with the DSE_SPAWN tag. If it finds any, it vaporizes them. This keeps your floor clean and prevents "Corpse Lag."
2. The VIP Registry (The List)

The system keeps a list of every player in the area.
   - If a player leaves, it removes them.
   - If a player enters, it adds them.
   - It automatically "heals" the list if there are gaps (the Void Fix).

3. The Live Scan (The Radar)

The script acts like a radar for every player:
   - It checks for living monsters within 40 meters of each player.
   - If monsters are found: It assumes the player is still "Busy" and waits.
   - If no monsters are found: It proceeds to the next phase.

4. The Dice Roll (The Action)

If a player is "Free," the system rolls a 100-sided die.
   - If the roll is equal to or lower than your Spawn Chance (default 20%), it spawns a new squad of monsters at a random point nearby.

- dse_inc	                The Settings. Change spawn rates, tags, and debug mode                                here.	N/A (Included in scripts)
- dse_area_enter            The Doorman. Registers players when they walk in.                                   	Area Events -> OnAreaEnter
- dse_area_exit	              The Checkout. Removes players when they leave.                                    	Area Events -> OnAreaExit
- dse_area_loop	             The Brain. Manages the scans, cleanup, and logic.	                                    Called by Entry/Loop
- dse_spawn_act             The Muscle. Actually puts the monsters in the world.	                                N/A (Called by Brain)

⚙️ How to Customize (For Beginners)

All major changes are made in one place: the dse_inc script.
   - To change the Difficulty: Adjust DSE_MIN_MOBS and DSE_MAX_MOBS.
   - To change the Frequency: Change the fWaitTime at the bottom of dse_area_loop.
   - To change the Luck: Adjust DSE_SPAWN_CHANCE. A 100 means a fight happens every single time the timer rings.
   - To see what the "Brain" is thinking: Set DSE_DEBUG_MODE to 1. This will send yellow text messages to your chat box explaining every move the script makes.

⚠️ Important Rules
    1. The Tag is King: Every monster you want the system to recognize MUST have the tag DSE_SPAWN.
    2. No Death Scripts Needed: You do not need to put anything in the monster's OnDeath slot. The Brain handles it!
    3. Area Settings: Ensure your Area is set to "Active" or has players in it, otherwise the loop will safely shut itself down.



Instalation

This document serves as the "Wiring Diagram" for the Dynamic Spawn Engine (DSE). It identifies exactly where each script file connects to the Neverwinter Nights Toolset.
📂 DSE System: Script Placement Guide
Script Name	            Toolset Location	            Event Slot	            Description
dse_inc	                  Script Editor	              N/A (Include)	          The "Settings" file. It is not placed in a slot; other scripts "pull" settings from it.
dse_area_enter	         Area Properties              OnAreaEnter	          The "Doorman." It registers Bob and Bill and starts the Brain Loop.
dse_area_exit	           Area Properties	            OnAreaExit	          The "Checkout." It notifies the system when a player leaves the map.
dse_area_loop	            Script Editor	              N/A (Virtual)	        The "Brain." It is called by the Enter script and then runs itself on a timer.
dse_spawn_action	        Script Editor	              N/A (Virtual)	        The "Muscle." It is called by the Brain to create and "Brand" monsters.

🕹️ Non-Script Setup (Required)

To ensure the scripts can "see" the players and monsters correctly, you must set these specific fields in the Toolset:

1. The Monster (Creature Blueprint)
    - Tag: Must be exactly DSE_SPAWN (or whatever you set in dse_inc).
    - ResRef: Must match the name used in the CreateObject line within dse_spawn_action (e.g., nw_skeleton).
    - Scripts: It is recommended to clear the OnDeath and OnHeartbeat slots to maximize server performance.

2. The Area (Area Properties)
    - Events Tab: Ensure dse_area_enter is selected in the OnAreaEnter dropdown.
    - Variables: No variables need to be set manually; the Brain script will create the "VIP List" automatically when Bob or Bill walks in.

🔍 Installation Checklist
    [ ] dse_inc is saved and compiled.
    [ ] dse_spawn_action is saved and compiled.
    [ ] dse_area_loop is saved and compiled.
    [ ] dse_area_enter is plugged into the Area's OnAreaEnter slot.
    [ ] dse_area_exit is plugged into the Area's OnAreaExit slot.
    [ ] Creature Tag is set to DSE_SPAWN.

Testing Tip: If you have Debug Mode turned on in dse_inc, your first test should be walking into the area. If the "Wiring" is correct, you will immediately receive a yellow message in your chat log saying "BRAIN: Starting loop..."
